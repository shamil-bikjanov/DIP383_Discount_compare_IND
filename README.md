# DIP383_Discount_compare_IND
[2nd Task] Version Control - Git Flow - Software Engineering task

Suggested software with a working title “Discount compare” will be at first a simple website that will allow a quick comparison of grocery products (by title and/or brand and/or specific title) among stores available in Riga: Rimi, Maxima, Lidl, Mego etc., when the user will be able to see if for example a pack of “Coca Cola” is now at full price at Mego and Rimi, but has 25% discount at Lidl until the stock lasts.

Update will be done using connection with apps/websites of these stores on daily or weekly basis and if website version shows success – an app for all mobile platforms can be developed at future stages.
